# Problem

Given an object and a list of strings with length n, for every string in the list, print the corresponding value in the object if it exists, else print -1.

Assume that all object keys and values are strings or numbers.

## constraints

0 <= n < 1000

# Author Description

The ability to extract values from objects is crucial in front-end development, and we explore this skill in this problem. Also, a candidate should know the concept of object types. Additionally, iterating over the members of a list is another front-end skill for a job seeker.

In this problem, we find out how familiar the candidate is with the mentioned features and can code cleanly.
