# Problem

Each person has a first and last name, as well as a height. n people are arranged in a row, and their current order is represented by list L. We sort the people by their height in a non-descending manner and display their new order with list LL.

The 'score' of the i-th place is defined as the absolute difference between the height of the i-th person in L and the height of the i-th person in LL.

Find the sum of the scores of all places.

## Constraints

0 <= n < 1000

# Author Description

Cloning a list and iterating on it are critical in the front-end domain. It is also imperative to sort the objects using the helper function. In addition, it is important to do this task optimally using the capabilities that the TypeScript language itself gives us.

In this problem, we find out how well the candidate knows how to clone a list, sort objects based on a specific field and the optimal iteration on it, and clean code.
